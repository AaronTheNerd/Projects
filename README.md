# Projects
A collection of my more memorable and professional projects.
### Why?
I was at the career fair at my University this year and I realized that 90% of my coding experience is on one line of my resume, just below my name: github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects. I doubt most employers looked at my resume long enough to even notice that URL. Additionally, on that repository most of my projects are small, maybe less than 100 lines of code and that means that I can't really have a good "Projects" section. That's why I'm making this repository. To put longer, more refined projects that I can put on a resume. Using API's, making Applications, implementing algorithms, etc.
