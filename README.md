# Projects
A collection of my more memorable and professional projects.
### Why?
I was at the career fair at my University this year and I realized that 90% of my coding experience is on one line of my resume, just below my name: github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects. I doubt most employers looked at my resume long enough to even notice that URL. Additionally, on that repository most of my projects are small, maybe less than 100 lines of code and that means that I can't really have a good "Projects" section. That's why I'm making this repository. To put longer, more refined projects that I can put on a resume. Using API's, making applications, implementing algorithms, etc.
### Goal
The goal of this repository is to have a clean area where all of my work can be easily observed and downloaded. These projects should properly display my experience programming and my ability to use other's software.
